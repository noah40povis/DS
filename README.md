# Data Science Unit 3 : Build Week
### Post It Here 1 

This is a forked repo from my Unit 3 Build Week Project at Lambda School. I will be updating this repo with a new model that will utilize our original dataset, but cleaned and wrangled differently. 

Goal: 
1. Build a better classification model 
2. Build API and add model predictions to it as well as NLP visualizations
3. Deploy model on heroku or aws. 
4. Integrate Postgres database that can store new data input by users.
